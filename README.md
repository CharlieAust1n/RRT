# RRT
This repository was a program developed for my CSC 495 - Introduction to Robot Motion Planninng class at North Carolina State University.

## Project Information
The goal of this project was to familarize ourselves with the RRT path planning algorithm and Forward Kinematics for a spatial manipulator.

## Contributions
The code in robot.py and rrt.py was developed mostly by me; however, most of the initalization was provided to us by our instructor.
